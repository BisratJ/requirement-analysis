# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## Introduction

This repository serves as a comprehensive guide to Requirement Analysis within the software development process. It covers essential concepts, activities, and practical examples—like use case diagrams and acceptance criteria—using a booking management system as a reference. The goal is to help developers, analysts, and stakeholders better understand how to define and manage software requirements effectively.

## What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is the process of understanding what a software system should do and why. It involves gathering input from stakeholders, analyzing their needs, and documenting clear, actionable requirements.

This stage is critical in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) because it lays the foundation for design, development, testing, and deployment. By aligning technical efforts with business goals, Requirement Analysis helps ensure the final product solves the right problems and delivers value to its users.

## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

- **Clarifies Scope**  
  It defines what the system should and shouldn’t do, preventing misalignment and feature creep.

- **Aligns Stakeholders**  
  Ensures everyone—from clients to developers—shares a common understanding of the system’s goals and functionalities.

- **Saves Time and Money**  
  Identifying issues early avoids costly revisions later in the development cycle.

## Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

- **Requirement Gathering**  
  Collecting raw input from stakeholders through interviews, surveys, observations, and other techniques.

- **Requirement Elicitation**  
  Digging deeper to refine and clarify requirements using brainstorming, workshops, prototyping, and more.

- **Requirement Documentation**  
  Structuring the information into formal documents like Software Requirements Specifications (SRS), use cases, and user stories.

- **Requirement Analysis and Modeling**  
  Examining relationships, conflicts, and dependencies among requirements, often using diagrams or models to visualize them.

- **Requirement Validation**  
  Reviewing requirements with stakeholders to confirm they are accurate, feasible, and aligned with business goals.

## Types of Requirements

### Functional Requirements

These define **what the system should do**—its features and operations.

**Examples (Booking System):**
- Users can search for properties by location and date.
- Admins can create, update, or remove listings.
- Users can complete a booking and receive confirmation.
- Users can register and log in securely.

### Non-functional Requirements

These describe **how the system performs**, focusing on aspects like performance, security, and scalability.

**Examples (Booking System):**
- Search results should load within 2 seconds.
- The system should support at least 1,000 simultaneous users.
- All user data must be encrypted using HTTPS.
- The application should maintain 99.9% uptime.

## Use Case Diagrams

Use case diagrams provide a high-level view of how users interact with the system. They help visualize the system’s functionality and ensure all user scenarios are covered.

**Actors:**
- Guest
- Registered User
- Admin

**Use Cases:**
- Search Properties
- View Property Details
- Register/Login
- Book a Property
- Cancel Booking
- Manage Listings (Admin)

## Acceptance Criteria

Acceptance Criteria are clear, specific conditions that a feature must meet to be accepted by the stakeholder or client. They define "done" and ensure both developers and stakeholders are aligned on expectations.

**Example – Checkout Feature:**
- The user must be logged in to initiate checkout.
- A summary of the booking should be displayed before confirmation.
- The system must verify payment success before finalizing the booking.
- A confirmation email should be sent after a successful transaction.
